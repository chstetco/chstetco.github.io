In my PhD thesis I am involved in the project **CapSize** which is a joint project between the University of Klagenfurt, Joanneum Research ROBOTICS, FH Kaernten and EED Automation GmbH.

</br>
### Project Statement:
> The goal of the project is to develop a modular human robot work cell, 
 where a human can collaborate and interact with the robot in a safe and intuitive way. 
 The system utilizes an easy to use gesture control based human robot interface, 
 which is also used to obtain inherent safety for the person working jointly with 
 the robot and allows for higher robot motions speed and thus better utilization. 
 It is expected that intuitive interaction and inherent safety will increase the acceptance of robot co-workers by humans.
