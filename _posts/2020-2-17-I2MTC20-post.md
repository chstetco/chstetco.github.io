title: [2 papers accepted for presentation at I2MTC 2020]
---

I'm very happy to announce that two papers where I was involved have been accepted for presentation at this years I2MTC in Dubronvik, Croatia.
I will present my work *"Gesture-based Contactless Control of Mobile Manipulators using Capacitive Sensing"* in a special session about
robot sensing technologies. Secondly, I am glad that our paper *Scalable Retrofit Angular Position Sensor System* which I co-authored together
with my colleague Harald Gietler will be presented.
