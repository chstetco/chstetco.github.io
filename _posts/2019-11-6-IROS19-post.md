I presented our paper *"Design of a Novel Gripper System with 3D- and Inkjet-printed MultimodalSensors for Automated Grasping of a Forestry Robot"* which was a very exciting experience for me since it was my first IROS conference. I enjoyed a lot of good presentations and conversations with other people from different fields.
