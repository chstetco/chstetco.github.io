I'm happy to announce that our paper entitled *"Radar Sensors in Collaborative Robotics: Fast Simulation and Experimental Validation"* was accepted for presentation at this year's ICRA conference in Paris! I'm looking forward to a great conference and am very excited to present our work there. As a first glance, you can have a look at our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEIvjmaUwdY).
