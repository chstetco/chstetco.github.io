Hi and welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Christian and I'm a PhD student at the [Institute of Smart System Technologies](https://www.aau.at/en/smart-systems-technologies/) at University of Klagenfurt. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from Graz University of Technology at the [Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory](https://www.spsc.tugraz.at/) where I was working on state estimation techniques for enhancing speech signals. During my masters I gained skills in statistical signal processing and modelling. My research interests are mainly in robotics and during my PhD I work towards a multi-sensor fusion approach for robotics applications such as grasping and human-robot collaboration. I have a strong belief that near-field sensing principles can further enhance current robotic systems by combining them with vision-based and tactile approaches.
